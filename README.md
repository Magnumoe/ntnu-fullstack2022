This repository contains the examples and code discussed in class. You may also find some of the code in BB.

- module1-intro: we discuss separation of concerns and coupling. We try to create a random list using 3 different version (each version has its flaws and even "bad" implementation). 

- module2-web-components: we introduce the topic of Web components, see step-by-step examples to build components and disucss how to share data (parent to component - attributes vs properties) vs component to parent - events).
